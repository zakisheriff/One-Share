## ✨ Why Lumen?

Forget the clunky, outdated file transfer tools of the past. Lumen is built from the ground up to be **fast, beautiful, and native**.

### 🎨 Stunning "Liquid Glass" UI
-   **Native Aesthetics**: Built with SwiftUI and designed to feel right at home on the latest macOS.
-   **Unified Window**: A seamless, translucent sidebar that merges perfectly with the title bar.
-   **Liquid Selection**: Files and folders highlight with a premium, rounded, and subtle glassy effect.
-   **Zero-Latency Interaction**: Instant selection and smooth hover effects that feel alive.

### 🚀 Blazing Fast Performance
-   **Native C++ MTP Bridge**: We don't rely on slow wrappers. Lumen talks directly to `libmtp` for maximum speed.
-   **Recursive Folder Download**: Drag entire folders from your Android device to your Mac instantly.
-   **Smart Caching**: Browsing directories is snappy and responsive.

### 🔌 Seamless Connectivity
-   **Auto-Detection**: Plug in your phone, and Lumen sees it instantly.
-   **Smart Permission Handling**: Forgot to unlock your phone? Lumen politely asks and auto-refreshes the moment you grant access. No restarts needed.
-   **Force Reconnect**: A dedicated "I've Allowed Access" button for when you need that extra push.
